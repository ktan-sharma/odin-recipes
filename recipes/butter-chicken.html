    <p><h2>DESCRIPTION</h2></p>
    <p>These butter chicken breasts are dipped in beaten eggs and cracker crumbs, then baked with butter. These chicken breasts are really tender and moist with excellent flavor!</p>

    <h2> INGREDIENTS</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup crushed buttery round cracker crumbs</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li> ½ teaspoon garlic salt</li>
        <Li>ground black pepper to taste</Li>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>½ cup butter, cut into pieces</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>DIRECTIONS</h2>
      
     <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
      <li>Place cracker crumbs and eggs into 2 separate shallow bowls. Mix cracker crumbs with garlic salt and pepper.</li>
      <li>Dip chicken in eggs, then dredge in crumb mixture to coat. Arrange coated chicken in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Scatter butter around chicken.</li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 40 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
      <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
     </ol>
